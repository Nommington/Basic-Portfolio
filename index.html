        <p>Ryan McKenzie is a hotel AV director and aspiring web developer. He is married to his seventh-grade sweetheart and has the two most perfect daughters in existence.</p>       
        <p>He doesn't know yet whether frontend or backend will be his cup of tea. Aesthetics are cool, and pretty stuff is pretty, but he is much more interested in logic and organization. So far, the nuts and bolts of HTML and CSS make sense to him, but he really wants to read that John Duckett book. He really enjoys and has always excelled at math and logic. Hotel AV offers precious little opportunity to really flex his problem-solving skills.</p>
